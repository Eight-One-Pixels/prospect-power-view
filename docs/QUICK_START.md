FROM waitlist
GROUP BY status;

-- Growth rate (last 7 days)
SELECT DATE(created_at), COUNT(*)
FROM waitlist
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |

| TypeScript errors | Run `supabase gen types` or keep `as any` |
| Table doesn't exist | Run the migration |
| Position not updating | Check triggers, run `update_all_waitlist_positions()` |
| Referral not working | Check referral code in URL (`?ref=CODE`) |

## 🎉 You're Ready!

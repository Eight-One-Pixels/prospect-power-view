## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy Database Migration
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: /supabase/migrations/20250627000002_add_email_automation.sql
```
This creates the email queue table and updates the referral function.

### 2. Deploy Edge Function
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → Edge Functions
2. Create new function: `send-waitlist-email`
3. Copy code from `/supabase/functions/send-waitlist-email/index.ts`
4. Deploy

### 3. Set Environment Variable
```
APP_URL = https://alo-sales.eiteone.org
```
(RESEND_API_KEY already set)

### 4. Build & Deploy Frontend
```bash
npm run build
# Then deploy to your hosting (Vercel, etc.)
```

---

## ✅ Testing

### Quick Test
1. Go to your landing page
2. Submit the waitlist form
3. Check your email inbox
4. Copy referral link from email
5. Open in incognito window
6. Submit form with different email
7. Check first email inbox again - should have referral success email!

---

## 📊 Monitoring

### Check Email Queue
```sql
-- All pending emails
SELECT * FROM waitlist_email_queue 
WHERE status = 'pending';

-- Failed emails
SELECT * FROM waitlist_email_queue 
WHERE status = 'failed';

SELECT event_type, status, COUNT(*)

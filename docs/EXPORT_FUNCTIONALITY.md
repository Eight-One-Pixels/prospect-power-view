  address: "Your Business Address",
  phone: "your-contact@email.com",
  logo: "üè¢", // Replace with logo path or emoji
  
  // Enable/disable branding
  csvBranding: true,
  pdfBranding: true,
  
  // PDF settings
  pdfOptions: {
    orientation: "landscape", // or "portrait"
    format: "a4", // or "letter", "legal", etc.
    quality: 2, // 1-3, higher = better quality
  }
};
```

### Report Titles
Customize report titles in the same file:

```typescript
export const REPORT_TITLES = {

## Troubleshooting

### PDF Export Issues
1. **Large Tables**: PDF export works best with tables that fit reasonably on screen

3. **Quality**: Adjust the `quality` setting in brandingConfig.ts if needed

## 🔄 Alternative Suggestion

If you want less manual work but still control access, consider:

### Self-Service with Approval:
1. Users can sign up freely
2. Account created as "pending"
3. You get notification
4. You approve/reject
5. They get activated

This is more scalable while maintaining control.
